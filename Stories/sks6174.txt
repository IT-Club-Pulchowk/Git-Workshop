Game of Thrones

Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned Stark reuniting with his dying sister Lyanna Stark in the Tower of Joy. 

Walking forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words.

Ned had brought Lyanna's child with him to Winterfell and claimed him as his bastard son to keep him safe.

Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar Targaryen never raped Lyanna. She loved
him and ran off with him, and bore him a son, Aegon Targaryen, making the bastard "Jon Snow" not only legitimate 
but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
