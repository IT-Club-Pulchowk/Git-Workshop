The animals from a farm in scotland were feeling upset. 
They were reflecting on their own lives. 
This is a story of farm animals starting a rebellion agianst thier owners. 
A group of pigs who were well-known for their wisdom, gathered all the animals
into a barn and held a meeting. The pigs convinced all animals of the fact that they were victims.
