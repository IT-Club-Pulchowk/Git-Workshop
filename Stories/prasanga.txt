What if there was a world where having Superpowers wasn't rare? 
What if most of the people had some sort of power?

The friends who flocked over John due to his brillance started avoiding him.
The ones who dispised him started bullying him. Why you ask,the reason is simple,

superpower in a world where it was common.
